# Elegant Chatbot: A Claude Code Masterpiece 🎨

## Vision Statement

Create the most elegant, simple, yet feature-rich voice-to-voice chatbot that embodies the principles of clean architecture, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, and progressive enhancement. This will be a complete reimagining from the ground up, designed by Claude Code - the best AGI agent out there!

## Core Design Principles 🏗️

### 1. **Radical Simplicity**
- One clear path for each operation
- No redundant abstractions
- Direct, readable control flow
- "Do one thing well" philosophy

### 2. **DRY Architecture**
- Single source of truth for all configurations
- Reusable components with clear interfaces
- No code duplication
- Centralized state management

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with core voice loop
- Add features as plugins/modules
- Each feature should be toggleable
- Zero dependencies between optional features

### 4. **Performance First**
- Optimize for real-time response
- Minimal thread usage
- Efficient memory management
- Smart caching where beneficial

## Phase 1: Core Voice Loop (Week 1) 🎤

### Goals
- Implement the simplest possible voice-to-voice conversation using OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano
- Single audio buffer, single state machine
- Direct function calls, no callbacks
- Hardcoded sensible defaults

### Implementation Plan

```python
# config.py - All configuration in one place
class Config:
    # Audio settings
    SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
    CHUNK_SIZE = 480
    
    # Model settings
    WHISPER_MODEL = "base"
    LLM_PROVIDER = "openai"
    LLM_MODEL = "GPT-4.1-nano"
    
    # Feature flags
    ENABLE_INTERRUPTS = True
    ENABLE_MEMORY = False
    ENABLE_EFFECTS = False
    
    @classmethod
    def get(cls, key, default=None):
        return getattr(cls, key, default)
```

```python
# core/voice_loop.py - The heart of the system
class VoiceLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.audio = Audio()
        self.stt = STT()
        self.llm = LLM()
        self.tts = TTS()
        self.state = State.LISTENING
        
    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self.state == State.LISTENING:
                audio_data = self.audio.listen()
                if audio_data:
                    self.state = State.PROCESSING
                    text = self.stt.transcribe(audio_data)
                    response = self.llm.generate(text)
                    self.state = State.SPEAKING
                    self.tts.speak(response)
                    self.state = State.LISTENING
```

### Deliverables
- [ ] Working voice loop with < 200 lines of code
- [ ] Single configuration file
- [ ] No external dependencies beyond core libraries
- [ ] Sub-2 second response time

## Phase 2: Smart Features (Week 2) 🧠

### Memory System Integration
Adapt the hierarchical memory system from the original codebase:
- Simplify the implementation
- Make it completely optional
- Store in simple JSON format
- Add to conversation context when enabled

### Interrupt Handling
Clean, simple interrupt system:
```python
# features/interrupts.py
class InterruptHandler:
    def __init__(self, voice_loop):
        self.voice_loop = voice_loop
        self.enabled = Config.ENABLE_INTERRUPTS
        
    def detect_interrupt(self, audio_frame):
        if not self.enabled or self.voice_loop.state != State.SPEAKING:
            return False
        
        if self.is_speech(audio_frame):
            self.voice_loop.stop_speaking()
            return True
        return False
```

## Technical Guidelines 📐

### Code Style
```python
# GOOD: Clear, direct, simple
def process_audio(audio_data):
    if not audio_data:
        return None
    return stt.transcribe(audio_data)

# BAD: Over-abstracted, complex
class AudioProcessorFactory:
    def create_processor(self, type):
        return ProcessorStrategy.get_instance(type)
```

### State Management
```python
# Single source of truth
class State(Enum):
    LISTENING = 1
    PROCESSING = 2
    SPEAKING = 3
    
# Direct state transitions
self.state = State.PROCESSING
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Simple, effective error handling
try:
    response = llm.generate(text)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"LLM error: {e}")
    response = "I'm sorry, I couldn't process that."
```
