# Quick Fix Summary

## 1. The OpenAI LLM Error is Fixed ✅
The missing `model` attribute has been added to the OpenAICompatibleLLM class.

## 2. To Use the New VAD (Better than WebRTC)

### Option A: Install PyTorch for Silero VAD (Best)
```bash
python -m pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# or
python install_silero_vad.py
```

### Option B: Just Use Energy-Based VAD (No Dependencies)
The Energy-based VAD should work automatically if PyTorch isn't available. It's still better than WebRTC VAD.

## 3. Check Which VAD You're Using
When you run `python main.py`, you'll now see one of these messages at startup:
- ✅ Using new VAD implementation (Silero/Energy-based)
- ⚠️ Using WebRTC VAD (consider installing PyTorch for better VAD)

## 4. Your Current Situation
Based on your output, you're still using WebRTC VAD, which is why you're getting the buggy behavior.

## 5. Try This Command
To force using the non-PyTorch Energy-based VAD:
```bash
python main.py --device cuda --vad-aggressiveness 2
```

The VAD improvements will:
- Stop constant false triggers
- Better distinguish speech from background noise
- Provide more reliable interrupt detection
