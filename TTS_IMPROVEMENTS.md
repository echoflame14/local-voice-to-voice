# TTS Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt for TTS Formatting

**File:** `configs/config.py`

Updated the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to include detailed instructions for proper text formatting for TTS processing:

```
IMPORTANT - Text Formatting for TTS:
- Use natural punctuation and spacing for proper speech rhythm
- Add commas for natural pauses: "Hello, how are you today?"
- Use periods for sentence breaks: "That's interesting. Tell me more."
- Use ellipses for longer pauses or dramatic effect: "Well... that's quite something."
- Spell out numbers and abbreviations: "twenty-five" not "25", "okay" not "OK"
- Use capitalization for emphasis: "That's AMAZING!"
- Avoid special characters that don't translate to speech: @, #, &, etc.
- Use quotation marks for dialogue: 'She said "hello" to me.'
- Break long sentences with commas and periods for natural breathing
```

These instructions help the LLM generate text that will sound more natural when converted to speech.

### 2. Voice Cloning Verification & Debugging

**File:** `src/tts/chatterbox_wrapper.py`

Added several improvements to verify and debug voice cloning:

#### A. Voice Cloning Status Logging
```python
# Add logging for voice cloning verification
if voice_path:
    print(f"ðŸŽ­ Using voice cloning with reference: {Path(voice_path).name}")
else:
    print("ðŸŽ¤ Using default voice (no reference provided)")
```

#### B. Voice File Validation
```python
def validate_voice_file(self, voice_path: str) -> bool:
    """Validate that a voice file is compatible with the TTS model"""
```

This method checks:
- File existence
- Audio properties (duration, sample rate, channels, file size)
- Optimal duration recommendations (5-15 seconds)

#### C. Enhanced Voice Setting
Updated `set_voice()` method to validate voice files when they are set.

### 3. Fast Chatbot TTS Instructions

**File:** `fast_chatbot.py`

Updated the fast chatbot's system prompt to include basic TTS formatting instructions while maintaining speed optimization.

### 4. Voice Cloning Test Script

**File:** `test_voice_cloning.py`

Created a comprehensive test script to verify voice cloning functionality:
- Tests synthesis with voice cloning
- Tests synthesis without voice cloning (for comparison)
- Saves both outputs for manual verification
- Provides detailed logging and validation

## Voice Cloning Implementation Verification

The voice cloning implementation is correctly set up:

1. âœ… **Configuration:** `config.VOICE_REFERENCE_PATH` points to `./voices/cosgrove_voice.wav`
2. âœ… **Initialization:** Voice path is passed through `VoiceAssistant` â†’ `ChatterboxTTSWrapper`
3. âœ… **TTS Model Call:** Uses `audio_prompt_path` parameter in `model.generate()`
4. âœ… **Fallback:** Gracefully handles missing voice files
5. âœ… **Validation:** New validation ensures voice files are compatible

## How to Test

1. **Run the voice cloning test:**
   ```bash
   python test_voice_cloning.py
   ```

2. **Check the logs for voice cloning status:**
   - Look for "ðŸŽ­ Using voice cloning with reference: cosgrove_voice.wav"
   - Or "ðŸŽ¤ Using default voice (no reference provided)" if something is wrong

3. **Verify voice file:**
   The validation will show voice file properties and warn about potential issues.

## Expected Behavior

- The LLM should now format text better for TTS (proper punctuation, spelled-out numbers, etc.)
- Voice cloning should use the `cosgrove_voice.wav` file for synthesis
- Debug output will clearly show when voice cloning is active
- The system will validate voice files and provide helpful warnings

## Troubleshooting

If voice cloning isn't working:

1. Check if `./voices/cosgrove_voice.wav` exists
2. Run the test script to see detailed diagnostics
3. Look for validation warnings about the voice file
4. Check the logs for "ðŸŽ­ Using voice cloning" vs "ðŸŽ¤ Using default voice"
